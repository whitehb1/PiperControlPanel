# PiperArm Control Tool

A Linux GUI and control-unit demo for the AgileX Piper arm. The project is designed for real-hardware manual control while keeping the core control interfaces independent from GUI, ROS, and future VLA/policy deployments.

Author: LiHaoming

## System requirements

Recommended environment:

- Linux with a graphical desktop session, VNC desktop, or SSH X11 forwarding.
- Python 3.10.
- Conda or Miniconda is recommended for reproducible installation.
- SocketCAN-compatible USB-CAN adapter.
- AgileX Piper arm and official `piper-sdk` Python package.
- CAN bitrate: `1000000`.

The GUI cannot open in a pure SSH/TTY session without `DISPLAY`. For headless smoke tests only, use `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen`.

## Important safety and CAN checklist

Before real-hardware motion:

1. Clear the robot workspace and keep people outside the arm reach envelope.
2. Confirm the arm is securely mounted.
3. Confirm you know how to use `Emergency stop` and `Disable motors` in the GUI.
4. Initialize and verify CAN before clicking `Enable`.
5. Do not move the robot if CAN state, bitrate, or feedback is abnormal.
6. Start with small joint-space motions. Mock mode passing does not prove real-hardware safety.

Find available CAN interfaces and USB bus information:

```bash
bash scripts/find_all_can_port.sh
```

Example output:

```text
can0 bus=3-1.2:1.0 state=DOWN bitrate=unset
```

Activate CAN using the detected bus value:

```bash
bash scripts/activate_can.sh can0 1000000 3-1.2:1.0
```

Verify CAN:

```bash
bash scripts/check_can.sh can0
```

Only continue when `can0` is `UP` and bitrate is `1000000`.

## Installation method 1: quick deployment

Use this path for a fresh Linux machine or VM.

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd PiperArm
bash scripts/install_system_deps.sh
```

Create and activate the conda environment:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate PiperArm
```

If the environment already exists, update it:

```bash
conda activate PiperArm
conda env update -f environment.yml --prune
```

Launch mock GUI without hardware:

```bash
bash scripts/launch_gui.sh mock
```

Launch real GUI after CAN is initialized:

```bash
bash scripts/find_all_can_port.sh
bash scripts/activate_can.sh can0 1000000 <detected-usb-bus>
bash scripts/check_can.sh can0
bash scripts/launch_gui.sh real
```

## Installation method 2: development / modified-code deployment

Use this path after changing code locally.

```bash
cd PiperArm
conda activate PiperArm
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -e ".[gui,real,vision,dev]"
```

Run checks after code changes:

```bash
PYTEST_DISABLE_PLUGIN_AUTOLOAD=1 pytest -q
ruff check .
python -m compileall src
```

Run the GUI from source:

```bash
bash scripts/launch_gui.sh mock
bash scripts/launch_gui.sh real
```

You can also run the installed console entry point:

```bash
piper-gui --mode mock
piper-gui --mode real
```

## GUI operation guide

Recommended real-hardware order:

1. Initialize CAN and run `check_can.sh`.
2. Start the GUI with `bash scripts/launch_gui.sh real`.
3. Click `Connect`.
4. Confirm connected/enabled/error state feedback looks plausible.
5. Click `Enable`.
6. Start in Batch mode with small movements.
7. Use Live mode only for small, deliberate posture debugging.
8. Use `Disable motors` when finished.
9. Closing the GUI is not an emergency stop. Use `Emergency stop` or `Disable motors` intentionally when needed.

### Joint angle control

The `Joint angle control` tab provides:

- 6 joint target inputs in degrees.
- 6 target sliders mapped to configured Piper joint limits.
- Radian readout for internal values.
- Gripper target input and open/close target buttons.
- `Send target` for batch movement.
- `Home target` for configured home pose.
- `Undo pose` / `Redo pose` in Batch mode.

All joint/gripper motion goes through [src/core/executor.py](src/core/executor.py) and [src/core/safety.py](src/core/safety.py).

### Batch mode

`Batch: edit then Send target` lets you edit joint angles, gripper values, or sliders before sending. Large moves are executed as multiple safe `max_delta` steps in the background. Undo/Redo records previously sent poses.

### Live mode

`Live: slider/value sends immediately` sends the latest target as you drag or edit values.

Live mode display semantics:

- Target spin boxes/sliders show the latest user command.
- `Actual deg` shows real robot feedback.
- `Error deg` shows target minus actual.
- `Tracking` shows real position in blue and remaining target gap in red.
- If you drag to 60 degrees and then back to 50 degrees before the arm catches up, the controller pursues the latest 50-degree target instead of queuing the old 60-degree target.
- A persistent red gap can mean the robot is still catching up, the command is being clamped by `max_delta`, or CAN/feedback is delayed.

### Cartesian pose control

The `Cartesian pose control` tab displays realtime end-effector feedback when the driver provides it. For real Piper, feedback comes from `GetArmEndPoseMsgs()` and is displayed as:

- X/Y/Z in millimeters.
- RX/RY/RZ in degrees.

Cartesian sending is experimental and disabled by default:

```yaml
robot:
  gui:
    experimental_cartesian_enabled: false
```

When enabled, Cartesian send uses Piper SDK MoveP / `EndPoseCtrl` units. Do not enable it until the safe workspace has been validated.

### Master / Slave setup

The `Master / Slave setup` tab is optional deployment tooling for Piper dual-arm teaching/linkage setups. It calls the official Piper SDK `MasterSlaveConfig` command.

It is disabled by default:

```yaml
robot:
  gui:
    master_slave_config_enabled: false
```

When enabled, it can set the current arm as:

- Master / teaching input arm: `linkage_config=0xFA`
- Slave / motion output arm: `linkage_config=0xFC`

Offsets default to zero:

- feedback offset: `0x00`
- control offset: `0x00`
- linkage/address offset: `0x00`

Advanced offset controls are hidden unless enabled:

```yaml
robot:
  gui:
    master_slave_advanced_offsets_enabled: true
```

Use non-zero offsets only when required by the official Piper deployment guide. Incorrect offsets can break command/feedback routing.

## YAML configuration guide

Main runtime configuration lives in [config/robot.yaml](config/robot.yaml).

### Mode

```yaml
mode: mock
```

Use `mock` for no-hardware testing and `real` for Piper hardware. The launch script can also override mode:

```bash
bash scripts/launch_gui.sh mock
bash scripts/launch_gui.sh real
```

Mock mode is intentionally kept because it lets users verify installation, GUI startup, tests, and control flow without a robot. It should not be treated as proof of real-hardware safety.

### CAN and control rate

```yaml
robot:
  can_interface: can0
  auto_enable: false
  control_rate_hz: 10.0
  state_timeout_s: 1.0
```

Keep `auto_enable: false` for safety. Enable motors deliberately from the GUI.

### Joint limits and max delta

```yaml
robot:
  joint_limits:
    min: [-2.6179, 0.0, -2.967, -1.745, -1.22, -2.09439]
    max: [2.6179, 3.14, 0.0, 1.745, 1.22, 2.09439]
  max_delta: [0.20, 0.20, 0.20, 0.20, 0.20, 0.20]
```

These values are safety-critical. `joint_limits` define slider ranges and safety clamps. `max_delta` limits how far one command can move each joint. Change them only after controlled review and real-hardware validation.

### Home pose

```yaml
robot:
  home_joint_position: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
```

`Home target` moves to this configured joint pose through safe multi-step motion. Adjust it if your lab uses a different safe home posture.

### Gripper

```yaml
robot:
  gripper:
    min: 0.0
    max: 1.0
    open: 1.0
    closed: 0.0
```

The real driver maps normalized gripper values to Piper SDK millimeter units. Hardware calibration may be required for precise gripper travel.

### Shutdown

```yaml
robot:
  shutdown:
    auto_disable: true
    stop_on_exit: false
```

`auto_disable: true` disables motor holding torque during normal disconnect/close. `stop_on_exit: false` means closing the GUI is not treated as an emergency stop.

### GUI options

```yaml
robot:
  gui:
    poll_rate_hz: 5.0
    experimental_cartesian_enabled: false
    master_slave_config_enabled: false
    master_slave_advanced_offsets_enabled: false
```

- `poll_rate_hz`: GUI state refresh rate.
- `experimental_cartesian_enabled`: enables Cartesian target sending.
- `master_slave_config_enabled`: enables the Master/Slave setup Apply button.
- `master_slave_advanced_offsets_enabled`: exposes advanced offset controls.

## Project structure

```text
config/      Runtime YAML configuration
scripts/     Installation, CAN, launch, and demo scripts
src/app/     Shared session/factory/manual-control layer
src/core/    Stable action/state/safety/executor/controller interfaces
src/drivers/ Real Piper, mock, and camera drivers
src/gui/     PySide6 GUI tool
src/policies Mock and remote policy adapters
tests/       Mock/safety/session regression tests
```

## Policy/VLA interface

The GUI is an auxiliary manual tool. Future VLA or remote policy deployment should use:

- [src/core/observation.py](src/core/observation.py)
- [src/core/action.py](src/core/action.py)
- [src/policies/base_policy.py](src/policies/base_policy.py)
- [src/core/controller.py](src/core/controller.py)

Do not couple future policy inference directly to GUI widgets.

## Troubleshooting

### GUI does not open over SSH

Use an Ubuntu desktop terminal, VNC desktop, or SSH X11 forwarding:

```bash
ssh -X user@host
```

Headless smoke test only:

```bash
QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen bash scripts/launch_gui.sh mock
```

### Qt xcb plugin error

Install system GUI dependencies:

```bash
bash scripts/install_system_deps.sh
```

### CAN is down or bitrate is unset

Run:

```bash
bash scripts/find_all_can_port.sh
bash scripts/activate_can.sh can0 1000000 <detected-usb-bus>
bash scripts/check_can.sh can0
```

### ROS apt GPG warning during apt update

If `apt update` shows a ROS GPG warning but Ubuntu packages still install, it can usually be ignored for this project. The GUI requires Ubuntu Qt/xcb libraries, not ROS.
